## A DIVER'S TALE

**IMPORTANT:** Try to use static (offline) data as much as possible. Also, do the login offline first (JSON file), but prepare services so that we can switch easily.

### Mock backend service

Mock data should be served using the mock backend service (see folder `divers-tale/mock-backend-service`). This allows a quick and easy exchange of the API endpoints with a real web service.

**IMPORTANT:** The mock backend service should always run in the background while developing. See `README.md` in `divers-tale/mock-backend-service`.

### Authentication

Credentials are not validated by the mock backend service, so you can login with any valid email.
