# Application architecture
There are five blank components located in these folders:
- `/browse`
- `/featured`
- `/home`
- `/search`
- `/settings`

Each of these pages has the following components:
- `ActionBar` - It holds the title and navigation button that opens the drawer.
- `RadSideDrawer` - The component to display a drawer on the page.
- `RadSideDrawer.drawerContent` - Part of the RadSideDrawer, it holds a custom component `MyDrawer` that displays the contents of the drawer.
- `RadSideDrawer.mainContent` - Part of the RadSideDrawer, it holds the main content for the page. You can expand this layout to modify each page.

There is a NativeScript custom component that holds the contents of the drawer.
- `/shared/my-drawer` - It holds the contents of the drawer that are reused on every page. There is a StackLayout for the profile info on top and a ListView for showing the navigation items. Expand this custom component to match what you want to have in your drawer.
